# CasEncryptoy-CasDecryptor
This is my first program written by go. CasEncroptor allows user input a text file which includes the plaintext. User need enter the key to encrypt plaintext, then the ciphertext and the algorithm of encryption will be return to user. The end of tail can output a new text file which includes ciphertext. 
All the details about CasDecryptor is vice versa.
